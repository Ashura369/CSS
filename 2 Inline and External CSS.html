    There are 3 ways to add CSS into HTML ;
        1/ Inline CSS -- used in an HTML page using style attributes
        2/ Internal CSS -- to add a style tag and place the HTML page's style within it
        3/ External CSS -- to create a .css file and place all your styles inside that .css file
    -->
    
    <h1 style="color: blue;", style="background-color: red;">This is Ashura</h1>
        <!-- There is a mistake in the inline CSS on the <h1> element where two style attributes are used. In HTML, you can only have one style attribute per element. Instead, you should combine both styles within a single style attribute, separating them with a semicolon.
            
            Hence here only first style = bluw will work.
            To add multiple styles do the below... -->
    <h1 style="color: blue; background-color: red; text-align: center;">This is the Jeet</h1>
            <!-- This is called Inline CSS, but this is not considered a good practice, bcoz when you do this you have to put styles into every tag individually.
             
            But if you use Internal CSS, you only have to write that tag in "head" tag for once and then all the content in that tag or in the same name tag will be automatiocally be changed into your desired style -->
