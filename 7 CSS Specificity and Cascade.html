        <!-- 
        
        Here only purple color was applied bcoz of the Cascade Algorithm...

            1/ Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
                (IF YOU CHANGE THE CLASS ORDER ie IF YOU BRING cred TO THE DOWN AND cpurple ABOVE THE cred STYLE WILL BE APPLIED)

            2/ Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
                (STYLE WILLBE APPLIED TO THAT SECTION WHICH IS MORE SPECIFIC IN NATURE
                
                ***SPECIFICITY NATURE = INLINE SELECTOR -> ID SELECTOR -> CLASS OR ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR -> ELEMENT SELECTOR -> UNIVERSAL SELECTOR)

            3/ Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS

            4/ Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
                (IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT OVERWRITS THE EVEN THE INLINE CSS THEN JUST TYPE "color: gold !important;")


            To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

                --Universal Selector: 0
                --Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
                --Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
                --ID selectors: 100
                --Inline styles: 1000

                *** IF YOU WRITE " h1.yellow {color: blueviolet;} THIS VALUE WILL BE APPLIED ABOVE OTHERS BCOZ, h1 = 1  and yellow = 10, HENCE 1+10=11. THUS THE VALUE OF THIS WILL BE APPLIED. BUT TO US ETHIS YOU HAVE TO REMOVE "!important".
        }"
